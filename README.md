# Credit Card Fraud Detection
This project focuses on detecting credit card fraud using various data science and machine learning techniques. The goal is to accurately identify instances of fraudulent activities within credit card transactions.

# Overview
-Objective: Detect fraudulent credit card transactions.
-Dataset: The dataset contains credit card transactions made by European cardholders in September 2013. It includes approximately 300,000 transactions over two days, with 492 frauds (0.172% of all transactions).
-Approach: We explore features, preprocess the data, and build machine learning models to classify transactions as legitimate or fraudulent.

# Prerequisites
Before running the project, ensure you have the following installed:

Python 3.6+
Jupyter Notebook
Required Python libraries (e.g., Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)

# Usage
1.Data Preprocessing:
Clean and preprocess the credit card transaction data.
Handle outliers and class imbalance.
2.Model Building:
Experiment with various algorithms (e.g., logistic regression, random forests, XGBoost).
Evaluate model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall.
3.Documentation:
Provide details on model selection, hyperparameter tuning, and insights from exploratory data analysis.
